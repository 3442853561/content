    <p>
        Thank you for downloading the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview.  Windows 10 IoT Core is the version of Windows 10 intended for development of
        embedded or dedicated purpose devices and the choice for the Maker community. This package contains the bits and tools needed to install a pre-release of
        Windows 10 IoT Core on the MinnowBoard Max based on Intel Atom E38xx series SoC (also referred to as MBM board) and the Raspberry PI2 based on
        the ARM Cortex-A7 based SoC (also referred to as the RPI).

    <h4>2. What's New</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows 10 IoT Core 5/12 release</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated base OS build</li>
            <li>Updated login-based Web interface for device setup, startup application configuration and feedback capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Release Notes</h4>
    <p>
        The default administrator user name and password are hard coded in the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview image. This is a security risk for the
        device, and it should not be exposed to an open internet connection until the password has been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Windows 10 IoT Core image included in this drop supports the peripherals that are exposed on the MinnowBoard MAX board. Subsequently, IntelÆ
        will provide support of the full feature set of the Baytrail processors including the IntelÆ CeleronÆ Processors J1900/N2930/N2807 and IntelÆ AtomÆ Processors E38XX.
    </p>
    <p>
        Windows 10 IoT Core is still being ported to the Raspberry PI. Support for audio input and output on the RPI is still under development and does
        not exist at all in this release. The video driver for the Raspberry PI is still under development, and it's performance has not yet been optimized.
        Animated user elements, such as XAML based drop down menus, in particular may display poorly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bluetooth connectivity is not fully implemented on either the MinnowBoard Max or the Raspberry PI2 for this release.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wireless networking is not fully implemented on the Raspberry PI2 for this release.
