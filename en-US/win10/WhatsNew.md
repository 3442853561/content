# What’s New for Windows IoT Core Insider Preview for Raspberry Pi 3 Users

&copy; 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved

We are excited to announce that you can immediately download Windows IoT Core for use on your Raspberry Pi 3 that offers the following benefits:

* Functional parity with RPi2, including Windows as a service updating and flighting model and a single FFU for RPi2 and RPi3

* Open sourcing Pi BSP to encourage community innovation/speed and support commercialization efforts

>## Coming Soon in a future release of Windows IoT Core Insider Preview
>* Onboard WiFi & Bluetooth, but in the meantime you can still use [a compatible USB WiFi/Bluetooth dongle](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/SupportedInterfaces.htm).
>
>* Functionality for unique innovation, including remote app UI to a phone or windows device, remoting of sensors and actuators from a windows device via UWP and closed loop control capable hardware interrupts via Arduino Wiring and our high performance driver. 

# What’s different? 
Change is inevitable, so it is worth noting that GPIO pins 35 & 47 as well as the onboard LED have been removed from the Raspberry Pi 3. Any projects you’ve built using this will only work with the Raspberry Pi 2.
