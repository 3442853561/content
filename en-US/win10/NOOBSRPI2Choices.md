### Don't forget to make your NOOBS Keyboard and Language selection

If you decide to choose the Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview, please be sure to make your appropriate language and keyboard selection. For example, US English keyboard users will want to change the language to **English (US)** and keyboard to **us** as shown here:

#### **WARNING:** What to do if you click cancel

It should be noted that if you choose **Cancel** here you will be presented with the following error dialog:

![NOOBS EULA Insider No Choice]({{site.baseurl}}/images/noobs/noobs-eula-insider-no-choice.jpg)

After clicking **Close** you will see:

![NOOBS - Need to Reboot (cancel os)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/noobs/noobs-need-to-eboot-cancel-os.jpg)

This is an unrecoverable error and requires you to physically reboot your Raspberry Pi 2 device to return to the operating system selection screen again.
