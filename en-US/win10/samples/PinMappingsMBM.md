##MinnowBoard Max Pin Mappings

Hardware interfaces for the MinnowBoard Max are exposed through the 26-pin header **JP1** on the board. Functionality includes:

* **10x** - GPIO pins
* **1x** - SPI bus
* **1x** - I2C bus
* **1x** - 5V power pin
* **1x** - 3.3V power pin
* **2x** - Ground pins

Note that the MinnowBoard Max uses 3.3V logic levels on all IO pins. In addition all the pins are buffered by [TXS0104E](http://www.ti.com/product/txs0104e) level shifters, with the exception of power and ground pins.
 These level shifters appear as open collector outputs with a **10K&#x2126; resistive pull-up, and the pull-up is present regardless of whether the IO is set to input or output.**
 The open-collector nature of the level shifters means is that the pins can output a '0' strongly, but only weakly output a '1'. This is important to keep in mind when attaching devices which draw current from the pins (such as an LED). See the [Blinky Sample]({{site.baseurl}}/win10/samples/Blinky.htm) for the correct way to interface an LED to the MinnowBoard Max.


##GPIO Pins

The following GPIO pins are accessible through APIs:

* **GPIO 0**
* **GPIO 1**
* **GPIO 2**
* **GPIO 3**
* **GPIO 4**
* **GPIO 5**
* **GPIO 6**
* **GPIO 7**
* **GPIO 8**
* **GPIO 9**

As an example, the following code opens **GPIO 5** as an output and writes a digital '**1**' out on the pin:

{% highlight C# %}
using Windows.Devices.Gpio;

public void GPIO()
{
	GpioController Controller = GpioController.GetDefault(); /* Get the default GPIO controller on the system */

	GpioPin Pin = Controller.OpenPin(5);        /* Open GPIO 5                      */
	Pin.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output);  /* Set the IO direction as output   */
	Pin.Write(GpioPinValue.High);               /* Output a digital '1'             */
}
{% endhighlight %}

##I2C Bus

There is one I2C controller **I2C5** exposed on the pin header with two lines **SDA** and **SCL**. 10K&#x2126; internal pull-up resistors are already present on these lines.

* Pin 15 - **I2C5 SDA**
* Pin 13 - **I2C5 SCL**

The example below initializes **I2C5** and writes data to an I2C device with address **0x40**:

{% highlight C# %}
using Windows.Devices.Enumeration;
using Windows.Devices.I2c;

public async void I2C()
{
	var settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(0x40); /* 0x40 is the I2C device address   */
	settings.BusSpeed = I2cBusSpeed.FastMode;       /* FastMode = 400KHz                */

	string aqs = I2cDevice.GetDeviceSelector("I2C5");                       /* Find the selector string for the I2C bus controller                   */
	var dis = await DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync(aqs);                    /* Find the I2C bus controller device with our selector string           */
	I2cDevice Device = await I2cDevice.FromIdAsync(dis[0].Id, settings);    /* Create an I2cDevice with our selected bus controller and I2C settings */

	byte[] WriteBuf = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04}; /* Some data to write to the device */

	Device.Write(WriteBuf);
}
{% endhighlight %}

###I2C Issues

The MinnowBoard Max has a known issue with the I2C bus which causes communication problems with certain I2C devices. Normally, an I2C device will acknowledge its address during a bus request.
However, under certain conditions this acknowledge fails to propagate back through the level shifters to the MBM, and as a result the CPU thinks the device did not respond and cancels the bus transaction.
The issue seems to be related to the [TXS0104E](http://www.ti.com/product/txs0104e) level shifters on the IO pins, which can trigger prematurely due to voltage spikes on the line.
The current workaround is to insert a 100 ohm resistor in series with the I2C SCK line, which helps suppress spikes. Not all devices are affected, so this workaround is only required if you are having trouble
getting a bus response.

##SPI Bus

There is one SPI controller **SPI0** available on the MBM:

* Pin 9 - **SPI0 MOSI**
* Pin 7 - **SPI0 MISO**
* Pin 11 - **SPI0 SCLK**
* Pin 5 - **SPI0 CS0**

An example on how to perform a SPI write on bus **SPI0** is shown below:
{% highlight C# %}
using Windows.Devices.Enumeration;
using Windows.Devices.Spi;

public async void SPI()
{
	var settings = new SpiConnectionSettings(0); /* Create SPI initialization settings using chip select line CS0 */
	settings.ClockFrequency = 10000000;          /* Set clock to 10MHz                                            */

	string spiAqs = SpiDevice.GetDeviceSelector("SPI0");                         /* Find the selector string for the SPI bus controller          */
	var devicesInfo = await DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync(spiAqs);              /* Find the SPI bus controller device with our selector string  */
	SpiDevice Device = await SpiDevice.FromIdAsync(devicesInfo[0].Id, settings); /* Create an SpiDevice with our bus controller and SPI settings */

	byte[] WriteBuf = new byte[] { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04 }; /* Some data to write to the device */

	Device.Write(WriteBuf);
}
