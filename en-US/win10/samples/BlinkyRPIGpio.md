###For Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2)

1. Connect the longer leg of the LED to GPIO 5 (pin 29 on the expansion header) on the RPi2.
2. Connect the shorter leg of the LED to the resistor.
3. Connect the other end of the resistor to one of the Ground (GND) pins on the RPi2.
4. Note that the polarity of the LED is important.

And here is the pinout of the RPi2:

Here is an example of what your breadboard might look like with the circuit assembled:
