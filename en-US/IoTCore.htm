<h2> Hardware Requirements </h2>
<hr>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-no-padding">
    <p>The requirements for Windows 10 IoT Core depend on whether it is run in a headed or headless mode. Headed devices have a video display and use Windows video subsystem to address it. Headless devices have no display. </p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
      400 MHz or faster<br>
      (x86 requires PAE, NX and SSE2 support)

    <h3>Memory</h3>
      <h4>Headless</h4>
        <p>256 MB RAM (128 MB free to OS) / 2 GB Storage</p>
      <h4>Headed</h4>
        <p>512 MB RAM (256 MB free to OS) / 2 GB Storage</p>
