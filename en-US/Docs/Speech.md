# Speech resources and samples

## Get started: 

Using recognition and synthesis capabilities provided by windows 10 IoT Core, you could build a complete speech interface for your devices. Here is the list:

* Speech Recognition (SR)
* Synthesizing Text to Speech (TTS)
* Continuous Dictation

## Official materials:

* [Quick start speech interaction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn630426.aspx)

* [IoT Core docs/samples](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/iot/win10/StartCoding.htm) 

* [MSFT Github with additional samples](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples)

* [Hackster Projects](https://microsoft.hackster.io)


## Windows 10 speech resources:
